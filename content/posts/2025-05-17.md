# AI interviews glitch, anger job seekers. Dystopian?

Hiring with AI has become common. 

But AI-driven interviews can feel impersonal and unfair. Candidates face awkward moments, technical glitches, and little chance to show personality. This affects how people view your company.
  
It’s not just about saving time. It shifts candidate experience. 
  
Consider these impacts:
- Reduced personal connection with candidates
- Risk of overlooking soft skills and potential
- Candidates feeling frustrated or disengaged
- Brand reputation affected by poor experience

To improve:
- Use AI to assist, not replace, human interaction
- Offer clear instructions and support during AI assessments
- Balance AI screening with live interviews
- Collect candidate feedback regularly to refine processes


Making AI work for people, not against them, will lead to better hires and stronger employer brands. How are you blending AI and human touch in your hiring?
