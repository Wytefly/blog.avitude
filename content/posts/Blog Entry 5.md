AI is about to change the game when it comes to jobs. The World Economic Forum says we'll see a whopping 78 million new job openings by 2030. But there's a twistâ€”nearly 40% of the skills we use today will soon be old hat.

So, what's that mean for us?

- **Get Ready to Learn**: We all need to keep learning and growing.
- **New Doors Will Open**: Jobs that need human creativity and problem-solving will be in high demand.
- **Skill Shortages**: Some jobs will be tough to fill because they need new kinds of skills.

Wondering how to keep up?

- **Keep Learning**: Make it a habit to learn new things. Focus on getting better at teamwork, creativity, and thinking outside the box.
- **Team Up**: Work with others to solve problems and come up with new ideas.
- **Be Adaptable**: Stay open to trying new roles as things change around you.

It's all about seeing the bright side of these changes.
