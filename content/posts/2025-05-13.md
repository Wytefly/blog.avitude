# AI Ad Portrays Tech as Escape from Chaos and Despair

Innovation isn’t just about creating something new; it’s about sparking a reaction. 

When [Pika launched its latest tool](https://www.adweek.com/media/pikas-provocative-controversial-ad-ai-post-apocalyptic-world/), the response was overwhelming. Social media erupted. 

This proves the power of resonance in our industry. 

- Drives engagement: Attention leads to conversations. 
- Amplifies reach: Viral moments extend your brand’s footprint.
- Strengthens communities: Shared excitement fosters connection.

So, how can we harness this energy in our own work? 

- Embrace authenticity: People connect with genuine stories. 
- Leverage feedback: Listen to your audience and iterate swiftly. 
- Create shareable content: Make your message easily digestible and relatable.

Remember, innovation is a journey. What steps are you taking to spark engagement in your projects?
